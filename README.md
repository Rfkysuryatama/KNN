# KNN
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. Specifically, KNN can be employed to predict the class or value of new data based on existing training data. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric, instance-based machine learning algorithm. This algorithm operates by calculating the distance between the data point to be predicted (test data) and the existing training data points. Subsequently, KNN takes the majority category of the K nearest neighbors (where K is a pre-defined number of neighbors) to determine the predicted class or value for the test data. KNN is often used in classification problems but can also be employed for regression, clustering, and anomaly detection. This algorithm is relatively simple but can yield good results, especially in cases of less complex data.
